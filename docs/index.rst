BioSim-A02's documentation
==========================
This project simulates the population of animals on the island of Rossum√∏ya,
a small island in the middle of the ocean that belongs to the island nation of Pylandia.
The island comprises of 4 land types: Water, Lowland, Highland, and Desert.
There are only two species of fauna- Herbivores and Carnivores.
This tool simulates behaviour of the island and the animals over the years and
plots the results using graphs and charts.

See Simulation Module for an example on running a simple simulation.
